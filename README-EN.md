# 1. Introduction
This project is a part of a team project, "Spring". The main objective was to make a Spring and Spring Boot based web portal with various functions, such as Shopping, Games, Movies, Weather, Map, etc. I was given a role to make a weather page and a map page of the web portal.

# 2. Functions
### Weather Page
- Shows your current location(South Korea Only)
- Shows current weather of your location with an icon
- Shows current temperature, wind speed, wind direction of your location
- Shows current weather of major cities of Korea
- Shows sunrise and sunset time of your location

### Map Page
- Shows your current location(South Korea Only)
- Can change map view to satelite view
- Can magnify and minimize the map

# 3. Tech Stack
- Languages: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- Server: Node.js
- Framework: Express.js
- Reason for this stack: I was going to make this with Spring framework, but it was easier to use Node.js to connect my localhost server to ngrok than Spring.
- APIs: Geolocation API(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API), OpenWeatherMap API(https://openweathermap.org/current), Kakao REST API - Local(https://developers.kakao.com/docs/latest/ko/local/dev-guide), Kakao Map API(https://apis.map.kakao.com/web/sample/)

# 4. Result
